    "# MySQL Exercise 9: Subqueries and Derived Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand how joins work, in this lesson we are going to learn how to incorporate subqueries and derived tables into our queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries, which are also sometimes called inner queries or nested queries, are queries that are embedded within the context of another query.  The output of a subquery is incorporated into the queries that surround it.  Subqueries can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses.  When they are used in FROM clauses they create what are called derived tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main reasons to use subqueries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Sometimes they are the most logical way to retrieve the information you want  \n",
    "+ They can be used to isolate each logical part of a statement, which can be helpful for troubleshooting long and complicated queries  \n",
    "+ Sometimes they run faster than joins  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some people find subqueries easier to read than joins.  However, that is often a result of not feeling comfortable with the concepts behind joins in the first place (I prefer join syntax, so admittedly, that is my preference).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subqueries must be enclosed in parentheses.  Subqueries have a couple of rules that joins don't:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ORDER BY phrases cannot be used in subqueries (although ORDER BY phrases can still be used in outer queries that contain subqueries).  \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Subqueries in SELECT or WHERE clauses that return more than one row must be used in combination with operators that are explicitly designed to handle multiple values, such as the IN operator.  Otherwise, subqueries in SELECT or WHERE statements can output no more than 1 row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So why would you use subqueries?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples.  \n",

    "#### 1) \"On the fly calculations\" (or, doing calculations as you need them)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main uses of subqueries is to calculate values as you need them.  This allows you to use a summary calculation in your query without having to enter the value outputted by the calculation explicitly.  A situation when this capability would be useful is if you wanted to see all the records that were greater than the average value of a subset of your data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall one of the queries we wrote in \"MySQL Exercise 4: Summarizing your Data\" to calculate the average amount of time it took customers to complete all of the tests in the exam_answers table (we had to exclude negative durations from the calculation due to some abnormalities in the data):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS AvgDuration\n",
    "FROM exam_answers\n",
    "WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)>0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to look at just the data from rows whose durations were greater than the average, so that we could determine whether there are any features that seem to correlate with dogs taking a longer time to finish their tests?  We could use a subquery to calculate the average duration, and then indicate in our SELECT and WHERE clauses that we only wanted to retrieve the rows whose durations were greater than the average.  Here's what the query would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM exam_answers \n",
    "WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time) >\n",
    "    (SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)) AS AvgDuration\n",
    "     FROM exam_answers\n",
    "     WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_time,end_time)>0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that TIMESTAMPDIFF gets compared to the singular average value outputted by the subquery surrounded by parentheses.  You can also see that it's easier to read the query as a whole if you indent and align all the clauses associated with the subquery, relative to the main query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1: How could you use a subquery to extract all the data from exam_answers that had test durations that were greater than the average duration for the \"Yawn Warm-Up\" game?  Start by writing the query that gives you the average duration for the \"Yawn Warm-Up\" game by itself (and don't forget to exclude negative values; your average duration should be about 9934):**"

    "EXISTS and NOT EXISTS perform similar functions to IN and NOT IN, but EXISTS and NOT EXISTS can only be used in subqueries. The syntax for EXISTS and NOT EXISTS statements is a little different than that of IN statements because EXISTS is not preceded by a column name or any other expression.  The most important difference between EXISTS/NOT EXISTS and IN/NOT IN statements, though, is that unlike IN/NOT IN statements, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are logical statements.  Rather than returning raw data, per se, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS statements return a value of TRUE or FALSE.  As a practical consequence, EXISTS statements are often written using an asterisk after the SELECT clause rather than explicit column names.  The asterisk is faster to write, and since the output is just going to be a logical true/false either way, it does not matter whether you use an asterisk or explicit column names.\n",

Rather than joining many duplicated rows and fixing the results later with the GROUP BY clause, it would be much more elegant if we could simply join the distinct UserIDs in the first place.  There is no way to do that with join syntax, on its own.  However, you can use subqueries in combination with joins to achieve this goal.  \n",
