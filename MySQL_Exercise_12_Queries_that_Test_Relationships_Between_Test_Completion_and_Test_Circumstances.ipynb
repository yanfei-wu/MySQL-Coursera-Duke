    "# MySQL Exercise 12: Queries that Test Relationships Between Test Completion and Testing Circumstances \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to practice integrating more of the concepts we learned over the past few weeks to address whether issues in our Dognition sPAP are related to the number of tests dogs complete.  We are going to focus on a subset of the issues listed in the \"Features of Testing Circumstances\" branch of our sPAP.  You will need to look up new functions several times and the final queries at which we will arrive by the end of this lesson will be quite complex, but we will work up to them step-by-step.  \n",

    "## 1. During which weekdays do Dognition users complete the most tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we are going to address is whether there is a certain day of the week when users are more or less likely to complete Dognition tests.  If so, targeting promotions or reminder emails to those times of the week might increase the number of tests users complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, the query we need to address this question might seem a bit intimidating, but once you can describe what the query needs to do in words, writing the query won't seem so challenging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want a count of the number of tests completed on each day of the week, with all of the dog_guids and user_guids the Dognition team flagged in their exclude column excluded.  To achieve this, we are going to have to use the GROUP BY clause to break up counts of the records in the completed_tests table according to days of the week.  We will also have to join the completed_tests table with the dogs and users table in order to exclude completed_tests records that are associated with dog_guids or user_guids that should be excluded.  First, though, we need a method for extracting the day of the week from a time stamp.  In MySQL Exercise 2 we used a function called \"DAYNAME\".  That is the most efficient function to use for this purpose, but not all database systems have this function, so let's try using a different method for the queries in this lesson.   Search these sites to find a function that will output a number from 1-7 for time stamps where 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, …, 7 = Saturday:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 1: Using the function you found in the websites above, write a query that will output one column with the original created_at time stamp from each row in the completed_tests table, and another column with a number that represents the day of the week associated with each of those time stamps.  Limit your output to 200 rows starting at row 50.**"

    "These results suggest that although the precise order of the weekdays with the most to fewest completed tests changes slightly from year to year, Sundays always have a lot of completed tests, and Fridays always have the fewest or close to the fewest completed tests.  So far, it seems like it might be a good idea for Dognition to target reminder or encouragement messages to customers on Sundays.  However, there is one more issue our analysis does not address.  All of the time stamps in the created_at column are in Coordinated Universal Time (abbreviated UTC).  This is a time convention that is constant around the globe.  Nonetheless, as the picture below illustrates, countries and states have different time zones.  The same UTC time can correspond with local times in different countries that are as much as 24 hours apart:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the weekdays we have extracted so far may not accurately reflect the weekdays in the local times of different countries.  The only way to correct the time stamps for time zone differences is to obtain a table with the time zones of every city, state, or country.  Such a table was not available to us in this course, but we can run some analyses that approximate a time zone correction for United States customers.\n",

HINTS: In this data set, the abbreviation for the United States is \"US\", the abbreviation for Hawaii is \"HI\" and the abbreviation for Alaska is \"AK\".  You should have 5,916 tests completed on Sunday of 2013.**"

    "The next step is to adjust the created_at times for differences in time zone. Most United States states (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) have a time zone of UTC time -5 hours (in the eastern-most regions) to -8 hours (in the western-most regions).  To get a general idea for how much our weekday analysis is likely to change based on time zone, we will subtract 6 hours from every time stamp in the complete_tests table.  Although this means our time stamps can be inaccurate by 1 or 2 hours, people are not likely to be playing Dognition games at midnight, so 1-2 hours should not affect the weekdays extracted from each time stamp too much. \n",
