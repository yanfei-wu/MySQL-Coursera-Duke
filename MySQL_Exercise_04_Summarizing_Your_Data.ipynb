    "# MySQL Exercise 4: Summarizing your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you practiced retrieving and formatting selected subsets of raw data from individual tables in a database.  In this lesson we are going to learn how to use SQL to run calculations that summarize your data without having to output all the raw rows or entries.  These calculations will serve as building blocks for the queries that will address our business questions about how to improve Dognition test completion rates.\n",

That should be impossible.  These types of entries probably represent tests run by the Dognition team rather than real customer data.  In other cases, though, a \"0\" is entered in the Duration column even though the start_time and end_time are different.  This is because we instructed the function to output the time difference in minutes; unless you change your settings, it will output \"0\" for any time differences less than the integer 1.  If you change your function to output the time difference in seconds, the duration in most of these columns will have a non-zero number.  \n",
